# mynotes
A repo with my study notes saved as markdown files.

## Editor
For taking notes, I use the BOOSTNOTE app for it allows me to insert code snippets easily into a well-formatted markdown text! (I tried evernote but due to the poor support for code snippets I changed my mind...)

## Saving
After editing my study notes with BOOSTNOTE, I export them to .md (markdown extension), and push them to this repo! The .cson files used by BOOSTNOTE are not commited since one can import the .md files directly onto boostnote and edit them!

## Folder structure

```notes/angular```: study notes for Angular

## Contributing
Should anyone find mistakes, typos or anything like that, please feel free to fork this repo and make PR with the changes!
